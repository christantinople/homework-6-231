## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

```{r}
# packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
library(rpart.plot)
library(vip)
library(janitor)
library(randomForest)
library(ranger)
#library(xgboost)
library(corrplot)
```

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

```{r}
# read in data
pokemon <- read.csv("data/Pokemon.csv")

# clean up column names
pokemon <- clean_names(pokemon)

# filter the pokemon types to make life easier
mons <- pokemon%>%
  filter(
      type_1=="Bug"|
      type_1=="Fire"|
      type_1=="Grass"|
      type_1=="Normal"|
      type_1=="Water"|
      type_1=="Psychic"
    )

# convert `type_1` and `legendary` to a factor
mons$type_1 <- as.factor(mons$type_1)
mons$legendary <- as.factor(mons$legendary)
```

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
set.seed(42069) # for reproducibiility

# get training and testing data
pokemon_split <- initial_split(mons,prop=0.8,
                               strata=type_1)

pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
```

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
# cross-validation folds
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v=5, strata=type_1)
```

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
# create recipe to predict `type_1`
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ ., data = mons%>%dplyr::select(type_1,hp:legendary))%>%
  step_dummy(c("legendary", "generation"))%>%
  step_center(all_predictors())%>%
  step_scale(all_predictors())
```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

```{r}
corr_mat <- model.matrix(~0+., data=pokemon_train%>%select(-c(x,name,generation,type_2,type_1))) %>% 
  cor(use="pairwise.complete.obs")

corr_mat%>%
  corrplot(method="number")
```

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune()))%>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)
```

```{r}
set.seed(42069)

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
```

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
class_tree_roc_auc <- collect_metrics(tune_res)%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))
class_tree_roc_auc%>%
  head()
```
We see the the best `roc_auc` metric is 0.6364470	corresponding to a `cost_complexity` of 0.004641589.	

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)

class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)

class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(), min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

rf_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rf_spec)%>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

param_grid <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1,8)),
                           trees(range = c(2,16)),
                           min_n(range = c(2,40)),
                           levels = 8)
```

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(42069)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  rf_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
```
```{r,include=FALSE}
load("three_param_tune.rda")
```

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
rf_roc_auc <- collect_metrics(tune_res)%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))
rf_roc_auc%>%
  head()
```
We see the the best `roc_auc` metric is 0.7289828 corresponding to `mtry` = 4, `trees` = 14, and `min_n` = 40.

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

```{r}
best_params <- select_best(tune_res)

rf_final <- finalize_workflow(rf_wf, best_params)

rf_final_fit <- fit(rf_final, data = pokemon_train)

rf_final_fit%>%
  pull_workflow_fit()%>%
  vip()
```

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

What do you observe?

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*
```{r}
boost_spec <- boost_tree(trees = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

boost_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(boost_spec)%>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

trees_grid <- grid_regular(trees(range = c(10,2000)), levels = 10)

set.seed(42069)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  boost_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = trees_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

autoplot(tune_res)
```

We observe that the ROC AUC value steeply increases with the number of trees up to around 500, and then the values kinda oscillate around a constant value as the number of trees increases.

```{r}
boost_roc_auc <- collect_metrics(tune_res)%>%
  arrange(desc(mean))
boost_roc_auc%>%
  head()
```
The best ROC AUC value is 0.7079029	corresponding to 1778 trees.
### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

```{r}
best_roc_auc <- data.frame(roc_auc = c(class_tree_roc_auc$mean[1],
                                       rf_roc_auc$mean[1],
                                       boost_roc_auc$mean[1]),
                           model = c("Pruned Tree",
                                     "Random Forest",
                                     "Boosted Tree"))
best_roc_auc%>%arrange(desc(roc_auc))
```
```{r}
# get the tune_res from the random forest
load("three_param_tune.rda")

best_params <- select_best(tune_res)

rf_final_wf <- finalize_workflow(rf_wf, best_params)

rf_final_fit <- fit(rf_final_wf, data = pokemon_train)
```

```{r}
augment(rf_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_auc(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
```
```{r}
# roc curves for the different factor levels
augment(rf_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_curve(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_Bug:.pred_Water) %>%
  autoplot()
```

```{r}
# visualization of the accuracy
augment(rf_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type="heatmap")
```

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
